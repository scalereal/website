Hello Android developers 👋, In this article, we’ll explore Kotlin’s Delegated property feature to solve a common problem in Android which will help us to reduce memory leaks.

_Memory management_ is an important thing to take into consideration while developing a good and performant application. While developing any application, a **_memory leak_** is a common problem while developing an application if we didn’t handle resources properly as per the _lifecycle_ events.

Let me give you examples. Imagine if you have a **_Fragment_** and it has references to some properties. We need to clear the references to these fields by assigning `null` in `onDestroyView()` lifecycle method so that Fragment won’t hold references to them.

🎬 Example 1
------------

You may have seen this snippet of code on [official Android’s docs for ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding#fragments) 👇

{{< gist PatilShreyas 3513835e881095b98f7e8d2b057b9252 >}}

Here, you can see that we need to create two fields `_binding` which is a _nullable_ backing field for _non-null_ field`binding`. What’s the reason for this? Read this 👇

> **Note:** As this is mentioned in the official docs. Fragments outlive their views. Make sure you clean up any references to the binding class instance in the fragment’s [onDestroyView()](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/fragment/app/Fragment#ondestroyview) method.

In this example, we need to declare these things twice. If we forgot to clear reference in `onDestroyView()` then it might lead to issues. We’ll see how to solve this after some time. Till then let’s take a look at another example.

🎬 Example 2
------------

When you have worked with _RecyclerView,_ sometime you might have experienced a memory leak issue due to _RecyclerView.Adapter_ even in configuration changes like a rotating screen. So for such cases, again we need to clean adapter reference in `onDestroyView()` lifecycle method as following 👇.

{{< gist PatilShreyas 700491abfef1e6877800dc4917cb2c45 >}}


Here you can see that we finally setting _RecyclerView’s_ _Adapter_ as `null`. Alternatively, as mentioned in **_OR (_**2️⃣**_)_** comments, we can also declare `mAdapter` as _nullable._ But if we do so then we’ll need to use `?` with adapter instance every time we try to access it 😫.

Here again, if we forget to set adapter as `null` in `onDestroyView()` then it might be a problem if there’s any process that tries to access the adapter.

In both examples, we used backing fields for references like `_ref` for every `ref` and **_nullified_** it in `onDestroyView()`. So how to avoid this _repetition_, make it _more readable_ or _reduce boilerplate_ for every Fragment/Activity or Android’s component?

💡 Solution
-----------

The [_Jetpack library for Lifecycle_](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) is a very powerful library by which we can develop Android _lifecycle-aware_ components which allow us to observe the lifecycle of components and thus we can handle things accordingly. Also, Kotlin has a variety of features and the [Delegated property](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/delegated-properties.html) is one of the great features. So let’s see it in action.

I read the source code of [AutoClearedValue](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/blob/08416a0aced0e4946e0765751a3b20f9a6222708/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/util/AutoClearedValue.kt#L31) from official samples and [Gabor Varadi](https://medium.com/u/7a8d96da8cb6?source=post_page-----3ad6d8875497-----------------------------------)’s [article](https://medium.com/@Zhuinden/an-update-to-the-fragmentviewbindingdelegate-the-bug-weve-inherited-from-autoclearedvalue-7fc0a89fcae1) where he mentioned a bug in this implementation. So this solution is inspired by the learnings of these two references.

First of all, add these Jetpack Lifecycle Component libraries

```
implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-common-java8:2.3.0")  
implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.3.0")
```

Create a class `AutoCleanedValue.kt` where we’ll wrap our logic for auto-nullifying references 👇.
{{< gist PatilShreyas 066edc8bf96804dcdd1cb7d930fb0410 >}}

Let’s understand it

*   `_AutoCleanedValue_`  is implementing a `ReadWriteProperty` which is a base interface from the standard library that can be used for implementing property delegates of read-write properties.
*   It has two parameters in the constructor i.e. `fragment` (since we are making it for Fragment as of now) and `initializer` lambda (_Optional_) which provides the initial value which might be helpful for immutable types.
*   There’s a field `_value` which will act as a backing field for references.
*   On initialization, we are observing the **View** lifecycle of a fragment and _nullifying it_ **_when the view lifecycle is destroyed_**.
*   In short, anybody can’t access the reference once Fragment’s `onDestoryView()` lifecycle method is called.
*   If the value is retrieved and if the current value is `null` due to Fragment’s lifecycle then its value will be re-initialized with the help of `initializer` (_if it’s provided_).

Okay! This is good. Now to make it easy to access from `_Fragment_`s, let’s make an extension function?

{{< gist PatilShreyas 624a4217d40b0e4552e3a3ee222eda73 >}}

Cool! Looks like everything is settled. Let’s see how our Fragment will look like after using this delegate? Let’s summarize both the examples we saw in this article in a single snippet 👇.

{{< gist PatilShreyas 059ac5610cb4559ca884b5b54c091967 >}}

That’s it. Looking cool😍, isn’t it?

What we achieved?

*   We don’t need to have an **_extra nullable backing field_** means we don’t need to have two fields for the same reference which will reduce the repetition of fields.
*   No need to nullify it **_manually_** in `onDestroyView()` since the delegate will take care of it and thus we now can reuse this for every Fragment in a project.
*   Thus it’s now more readable with a reduced boilerplate 😎.

Now, this was just for Fragment. If we need we can extend it up to Activity, Service, etc.

I hope you liked this article. Share this if you find it helpful so that it can help someone who needs it. _Sharing is caring!_

Thank you. Have fun! 😄
