### What is StateFlow ?🤷‍♂️

* It’s basically a new primitive for state handling.

* It’s designed to eventually replace [ConflatedBroadcastChannel](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/-conflated-broadcast-channel/index.html) for state publication scenarios.

* It is a *flow* that emits updates to its collectors.

* Value can be observed by collecting values from the *flow* 🌊.

### Still not getting? Here’s a quick demo to understand —

I think now you get it what’s exactly — StateFlow😃. So what’s happening here is whenever we’re updating the value of ***stateFlow*** then it emits value to its *collectors*.

To manage state in Android we generally used Android Arch. component’s [*LiveData*](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) which is lifecycle-aware. We can replace it with *StateFlow* .Let’s see how to use it with Android. Let’s write some code!

## ⚡️ Getting Started

Open *Android Studio* and create a new project. Alternatively, you can simply clone [this repository](https://github.com/scalereal/StateFlow-Demo). This is a very simple *counter* app for demonstrating the use of Kotlin Coroutine’s *StateFlow* API.

We’ll be using MainViewModel to manage our data of MainActivity.

Now you can compare its implementation using *LiveData*

* MutableStateFlow has a setter property for *value*

* We’ve declared an instance of StateFlow i.e. *countState* which we’re exposing for activity *(It’s a read-only field)*.

* *StateFlow* has a property called *value* by which you can be safely read at any time.

Now let’s implement our MainActivity —

Here, we’ve initialized ViewModel for activity. Now let’s implement the initView() method which will initialize our Counter App UI.

Everything looks cool now! 😃. Let’s observe for count value now to keep track of counting and show it on UI accordingly.

Here’s we have collector which will be executed whenever the value of a *countState* is updated. We also made it **lifecycle-aware** as we’ve used it under lifecycleScope. It looks simple, right? That’s it! 😎

Now let’s run this app and see if it’s working.

Ain’t it Sweettttt 😍.

### We can implement the same using ***LiveData*** too. What’s different then? 🤷‍♂️

We can use powerful *flow* operators with StateFlow like ***combine, zip, etc*** which can give us more great experience than *LiveData* Yes, that’s it.

### Final Words:

* *StateFlow* is really easy to handle and implement.

* Its behaviour is the same as *LiveData* along with more operators and great performance 😎. Then we should consider using it instead of *LiveData*.
