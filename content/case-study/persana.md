    <strong>
        Understanding The Project Challenges
    </strong>
</h2>
{{< /case-study/caseStudySubtitle >}}

* __Lack of Good Resource:__ The development process was hindered by an insufficient number of skilled developers and designers. This shortage of qualified personnel resulted in delays, reduced productivity, and ultimately, a subpar final product that did not meet the initial project requirements or expectations.
* __Lack of Technical Oversight:__ The original development lacked proper technical leadership, resulting in inconsistent outputs and no cohesive direction. This absence of experienced technical oversight meant that best practices were not followed, leading to architectural flaws and inefficient code that were difficult to maintain and scale.
* __Scalability Issues:__ Scalability issues in the app manifested in several ways: It struggled to handle a large volume of concurrent requests, causing significant delays and errors. The user interface (UI) often became unresponsive or stuck when processing a high number of requests simultaneously. Additionally, the app failed to manage multiple processes at once, leading to crashes and decreased functionality under heavy load.
* __Low Code Quality and Unorganized Projects:__ The codebase was characterized by low quality, with numerous bugs, poor documentation, and lack of adherence to coding standards. This made the application difficult to maintain and extend, leading to frequent issues during updates and new feature implementations. The low code quality also increased the risk of security vulnerabilities and system failures.

* __Moved Repositories Under Organization's GitHub Account:__ Repositories were centralized under the organization's GitHub account to enhance collaboration, improve security, and streamline management.
* __Integrated Sentry with Slack:__ Sentry was integrated with Slack to provide real-time error notifications, enabling quick awareness, collaborative resolution, and better tracking of recurring issues.
* __Auto Deployment:__ An automated deployment process was implemented using CI/CD pipelines to ensure quick, reliable rollouts with minimal downtime and enhanced scalability.
* __Queue System on Back End to Handle Large Number of Requests:__ A robust queue system was established on the back end to manage high request volumes, enabling load balancing, asynchronous processing, and scalability.
* __Reduced Load from Front End and Moved Things to Back End:__ Processing load was shifted from the front end to the back end, optimizing performance and enhancing user experience by leveraging powerful server resources for intensive tasks.
